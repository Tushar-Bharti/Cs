It is assumed that after each operation the content of the array  should be updated. Further, you must check the two conditions. These are (i) if array is  empty and next operation is deletion, then it must display the message as “UNDER  FLOW”, and (ii) if array if full and next operation is insertion, then it must display the  message as “OVER FLOW”. ](./del&insertonarray.md)***
